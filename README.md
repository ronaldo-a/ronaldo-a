Hi, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ronaldo (yeah! just like the football player) and i'm a Civil Engineer (and future web developer for sure) from Brazil who wich was presented to the fascinating world of programming and decided to take the trip into it.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning fullstack web development at Driven Education 

By now, i have been working with <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/html5/html5-original-wordmark.svg" alt="html5" width="30" height="30"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/css3/css3-original-wordmark.svg" alt="css3" width="30" height="30"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" alt="javascript" width="30" height="30"/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/react/react-original-wordmark.svg" alt="react" width="30" height="30"/>

In case you wanna talk, just send me a hello and we can talk about programming, sports (i love almost all of them), Harry Potter or anything else.
