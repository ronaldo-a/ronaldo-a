Hi, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ronaldo (yeah! just like the football player) and i'm a Civil Engineer (and future web developer for sure) from Brazil who wich was presented to the fascinating world of programming and decided to take the trip into it.

At the moment i'm working at IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), studying fullstackoverflow web development at Driven Education and getting amazed  everyday ðŸ˜¯ by the power of programming.

In case you wanna talk, you cand find me at ronaldoandrade966@gmail.com. Send me a hello and we can talk about programming, sports (i love almost all of them), Harry Potter or anything else.

By now, i have been working with <svg role="img" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><title>HTML5</title><path d="M1.5 0h21l-1.91 21.563L11.977 24l-8.564-2.438L1.5 0zm7.031 9.75l-.232-2.718 10.059.003.23-2.622L5.412 4.41l.698 8.01h9.126l-.326 3.426-2.91.804-2.955-.81-.188-2.11H6.248l.33 4.171L12 19.351l5.379-1.443.744-8.157H8.531z"/></svg>
